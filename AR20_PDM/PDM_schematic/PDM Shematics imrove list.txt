ERRORS FOUND IN VERSION ALPHA :


Miscellaneous thoughts, up for consideration:
				
- Remove all Ground loop										: YEASSS!
- Relly neccesary with two shutdown active leds, one for inn and one after ACM-Shutdown mosfet?
Have one "digital" shutdown led insted, controlled by acm.						: Maybee ??
					
- Termination resistor ? 										: Maybee ??
- A ACM, shutdown bypass jumper/solder jumper/dip switch.						: No need, can jump over the mosfet if really neccesary.
- Try to separate, i2c and canbuss more from the rest ?							: Work well, no need.
- Flere knapper ? Til å gjøre forskjellige ting, som for eks, max kjøling.				: Enough complications at this point. Improvement AR 2021.

- Enn innput som forteller pdm at bilen starter,						
  dermed kan pdm skru av det meste av strømmen til pumper og etc. Kan dette gjøre via canbuss?		: Fixed via cannbuss


Observed behaviour, up for consideration:

- Led for blown fuse gets power from fuse directly. Will not detect blown trace. Move pickup point to connector.	: TBA			
- Silkskreen for differating leds, and fuses.										: 


Major Errors, Needs fixing: 

- Relay footprint, NC and NO pads Switched.     								: Fixed in footprint
- N-mosfets Flipped Gate and Source										: Created own spesific symbol and footprint per mosfet modell. Both P & N channel.
- 3.9R resistor, to big comparet to footprint									: Changed to correct footprint. Might change the resistor alltogether.
- Pads on, the dip Switch footprint slightly to short								: Created new footprint

- Correction, not a matter of enhancment or depletion mode. 							: Redesigned whole Power mosfet activation circuit. 
  Used P mos as low side switch, and N as high side. NOT GOOD.							 Altso Fixed all mosfet affected, both P & N channel

- Reversed + and -  of the INA 233 sense pins. Negative ofset							: Fixed in chematics, reverted to correct configuration					
- Vbus of the INA 233 on the positive, should be on the negative
- INA233 fried somehow, when shorting the circuit, might be because of the reversed + and - of the INA 233	: 
- Used N-mosfet as highside swithc for shutdown circuit, would never work					: Redesigned
- Used N-mosfets as MUX. Would not work, because of high "Source" resistance					: Switched to a multiplexer IC
