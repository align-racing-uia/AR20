Miscellaneous thoughts, up for consideration:

- Remove all Ground loop
- Relly neccesary with two shutdown active leds, one for inn and one after ACM-Shutdown mosfet?
Have one "digital" shutdown led insted, controlled by acm.
- Termination resistor ? 
- A ACM, shutdown bypass jumper/solder jumper/dip switch.
- Try to separate, i2c and canbuss more from the rest ?
- Flere knapper ? Til å gjøre forskjellige ting, som for eks, max kjøling.
- Enn innput som forteller pdm at bilen starter, dermed kan pdm skru av det meste av strømmen til pumper og etc. Kan dette gjøre via canbuss?


Observed behaviour, up for consideration:

- Led for blown fuse gets power from fuse directly. Will not detect blown trace. Move pickup point to connector.
- Silkskreen for differating leds, and fuses.


Major Errors, Needs fixing: 

- Relay footprint, NC and NO pads Switched.
- 3.9R resistor, to big comparet to footprint
- Pads on, the dip Switch footprint slightly to short
